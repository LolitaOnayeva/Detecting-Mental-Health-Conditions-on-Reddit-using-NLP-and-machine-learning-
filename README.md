This repository contains classification models that I have created for my Master's degree project. 
Each file represetns a different model (either different classifier or same classifier but changed hyperparamenters). 
The dataset used was obtained from https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.YUx8ay1Q1bX and modififed according to the needs of the project.
